# Data-analysis-on-Illinois-Dataset
Predictive modelling and Clustering of Customer data of a Supermarket in Illinois.

Problem Statement
CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR IN RETAIL STORE
Concept:
A retail store at Illinios wants to get an idea about the customer purchase behaviour against three different product categories. The store made efforts to collect data based on the transactions made at the store.
Content :
	The data set consists of 12 variables, which includes User ID, Transaction ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, City Category, Stay_in_current_city_years, Marital status, Product Category and Purchase amount.
The User Id is the unique customer identification number given at the store and Product ID is the unique Id given for each product. The products are categorised into three groups based on their utility.
The variable “Age” is classified into 6 bins as follows: 0-17,18-25,26-35,36-45,46-55 and above 55 years; “Occupation” is coded between 0-20;  “City” is categorised as A,B,C,D based on the demography.  
•	Generate a model to predict the amount of purchase with the help of the information contained in the other variables.
•	Cluster the data set into different consumer groups and report your inferences above the study of sales through consumer behaviour.
For testing, you should provide a function, which takes in the path of a test csv file(it would be in the same format as the train file) and prints out the accuracy/relevant metrics.
